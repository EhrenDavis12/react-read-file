## Collection of Coding Challenges

This is a project put together to create a collection of quick challenges.<br />
Each programming collection I encounter I will place into this project.

Here is a link to the [Deployed Solution](https://react-read-file-app.herokuapp.com/)!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setup

### `npm install`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
