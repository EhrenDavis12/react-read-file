The Ready To Go component in react-read-file lacks an interactive Chunk an Array coding challenge. Users cannot practice or get feedback on this problem.

The desired outcome is a fully functional Chunk an Array challenge. Users will input an array and chunk size, run the logic, and see the correct chunked output with error handling.

This involves creating a chunkArray utility function in src utils arrayUtils.js, then integrating it into src components ReadyToGo ReadyToGo.js. The UI will have input fields for array as a JSON string and chunk size, a run button, and an output display. Client-side input parsing and validation are required.

Example acceptance: If input is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and 2, output should be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10.
Example error: If array is 1 2 3 and chunk size is 0, display Chunk size must be a positive integer.
Example error: If array string is malformed like 1 2 3, display Invalid array format.

The AI needs to clarify if this ticket also includes the Standard FizzBuzz challenge implementation or is solely for Chunk an Array. Also, complete the user story Then Solve the problem allow the what specific user action outcome is desired e.g. to submit their code to see systems solution.

To update the "Ready To Go" challenge to the new name "Chunk an Array," we need to modify the `src/components/SubProjectPageHeader.js` file. Here is the change:

src/components/SubProjectPageHeader.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        <InfoModel title="The Challenge" ButtonText="Read The Challenge">
=======
        <InfoModel title="Chunk an Array" ButtonText="Read Chunk an Array">
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change updates the title and button text to reflect the new name of the challenge.

Here is the change to update the challenge name in `src/components/SubProjectPageHeader.js`:

src/components/SubProjectPageHeader.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH

#### /code Update the Ready To Go Code Challenge title to Testing Auto Change  

#### Update the Ready To Go Code Challenge title to Testing Auto Change  

To update the title of the "Ready To Go Code Challenge" to "Testing Auto Change", we need to modify the `Page.js` files in both `ReadyToGo` and `ReadyToGo_Keep` directories.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

src/containers/ReadyToGo/Page.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            <PageHeader title="Ready To Go Code Challenge">
=======
            <PageHeader title="Testing Auto Change">
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

src/containers/ReadyToGo_Keep/Page.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            <PageHeader title="Ready To Go Code Challenge">
=======
            <PageHeader title="Testing Auto Change">
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

To implement the Chunk an Array challenge in the Ready To Go component, we will need to:

1. Create a new utility function `chunkArray` in `src/utils/arrayUtils.js`.
2. Integrate this utility function into the `ReadyToGo` component, likely in `src/containers/ReadyToGo/Page.js` or a child component.

Please add the following files to the chat so I can provide the necessary changes:

- `src/containers/ReadyToGo/Page.js`
- `src/utils/arrayUtils.js` (if it doesn't exist, I will create it)

To implement the Chunk an Array challenge, we will:

1. Create a new utility function `chunkArray` in `src/utils/arrayUtils.js`.
2. Integrate this utility function into the `ReadyToGo` component in `src/containers/ReadyToGo/Page.js`.

Let's start by creating the `chunkArray` utility function:

src/utils/arrayUtils.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
export function chunkArray(array, size) {
    if (!Array.isArray(array)) {
        throw new Error("Invalid array format. Please use valid JSON array syntax.");
    }
    if (typeof size !== 'number' || size <= 0) {
        throw new Error("Chunk size must be a positive integer.");
    }
    const result = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i += size) {
        result.push(array.slice(i, i + size));
    }
    return result;
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Next, we will integrate this function into the `ReadyToGo` component by adding input fields, a run button, and a display for the results or errors:

src/containers/ReadyToGo/Page.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
import React from "react";
=======
import React, { useState } from "react";
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
import { ReadyToGoProvider } from "./Context";
=======
import { chunkArray } from "../../utils/arrayUtils";
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return (
=======
    const [arrayInput, setArrayInput] = useState("[]");
    const [chunkSize, setChunkSize] = useState(1);
    const [result, setResult] = useState(null);
    const [error, setError] = useState("");

    const handleRun = () => {
        try {
            const parsedArray = JSON.parse(arrayInput);
            const parsedSize = parseInt(chunkSize, 10);
            const chunkedArray = chunkArray(parsedArray, parsedSize);
            setResult(chunkedArray);
            setError("");
        } catch (err) {
            setError(err.message);
            setResult(null);
        }
    };

>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            <ReadyToGoProvider>
=======
            <div>
                <label>
                    Array (JSON format):
                    <input
                        type="text"
                        value={arrayInput}
                        onChange={(e) => setArrayInput(e.target.value)}
                    />
                </label>
                <label>
                    Chunk Size:
                    <input
                        type="number"
                        value={chunkSize}
                        onChange={(e) => setChunkSize(e.target.value)}
                    />
                </label>
                <button onClick={handleRun}>Run</button>
                {error && <p style={{ color: "red" }}>{error}</p>}
                {result && <pre>{JSON.stringify(result, null, 2)}</pre>}
            </div>
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will add the necessary functionality to the `ReadyToGo` component, allowing users to input an array and chunk size, execute the logic, and view the output or any error messages.

The issue in the code is that the `Container` component is not properly closed before the `return` statement. Let's fix this by ensuring the JSX is correctly structured:

src/containers/ReadyToGo/Page.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        <Container style={{ paddingBottom: "100px" }}>
=======
    return (
        <Container style={{ paddingBottom: "100px" }}>
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                <ActionBar/>
                <ResultDisplay/>
            </ReadyToGoProvider>
=======
            <ActionBar/>
            <ResultDisplay/>
        </Container>
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes ensure that the `Container` component is properly wrapped around the content and the `return` statement is correctly placed.

The error in the code is due to an extra closing `</Container>` tag. Let's fix this by removing the redundant tag:

src/containers/ReadyToGo/Page.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        </Container>
